# Quietnet Presentation

This is the code for a 5 minute Hack and Tell presentation I gave on [Quietnet](https://github.com/Katee/quietnet).

The code is quite messy but I think the approach of using live graphs for everything worked really well.

Warning: This was for a 5 minute demo, I've only tested the code in Chrome and it likely won't work other places.
