# Quietnet Presentation

This is the code for a 5 minute Hack and Tell presentation I gave on [Quietnet](https://github.com/Katee/quietnet).

The code is quite messy but I think the approach of using live graphs for everything worked really well.

## Usage

Run `npm install`, `node app.js` and point your browser (really Chrome, not tested anywhere else) to localhost:8881

## Tools

 * [D3.js](http://d3js.org/)
 * [Recorderjs](https://github.com/mattdiamond/Recorderjs)
 * [Impress.js](https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js)

Warning: This was for a 5 minute demo, I've only tested the code in Chrome and it likely won't work in other browsers.
